OBJECTIVE:

1.) To compute the drag force experienced by a cyclist using python and sublime. 

2.) Developing code to plot (velocity vs drag force) and (drag-coefficient vs drag Force).

INTRODUCTION:

The force generated on the frontal area of a bicycle due to air resistance is known as drag. Studies shows that when cycling reaches a speed of 14m/sec and above, aerodynamic drag becomes the most dominant resistive force. More than 90% of the total mechanical Output generated by cycling gets used up to overcome that force. There are two types of drag a cyclist needs to overcome to reach their maximum speed.

 a) Pressure Drag

Pressure Drag is caused by the air particles being more compressed (pushed together) on   the front-facing surfaces and more spaced out on the back surfaces. The air particles seem   to put more pressure on the front surfaces of cycle and rider compared to the back causing   a difference in air pressure. It can be avoided by staying close to the cycle by lowering the   body so that air stays attached as it flows over the back.

 b) Skin Friction

In cases where road surfaces are rough, air particles closer strikes with the rough surfaces   of road and slows down which in turn slows down the air particles of later layers. The region   of air where the speed of the particles has been changed is called the boundary layer. It can   be reduced by keeping road surfaces smooth and wearing skin tight outfits.

c) Frontal Area

The projected frontal area represents the area which can be seen by the observer when placed exactly at the front of the body i.e the surface normal to fluid displacement.

METHODOLOGY:

a) Assumptions

 i.)  Frontal Area is assumed to be constant through out.

 ii.) Effect of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity on density of air is  neglected. 

 iii.) Density of air is constant.

 iv.) Maximum Velocity = 50 kmph or 14m/sec.

b) Drag Force Calculation

The formula used to calculate drag force is given by

`F_d =1/2 rhoAv^2c_d`

Where, `F_d` = Drag Force in Newton (N)

 `rho =`Density in `(kg)/m^3`

 `A`= Frontal Area (`m^2`

`v=`Velocity in (m/sec)

`c_d =`Drag Coeffcient

CASE -1 :

Firstly, we are going to keep the value of co-efficient of drag as constant value, create an array of velocities, compute drag force at different velocities and finally plot the graph for velocity vs drag force.

a) Input parametres

  `rho` = 1.2 (kg)/m^3`

`A = 0.1 m^2`

`c_d= 0.8`

`v = [2, 4 ,6,8,10,12,14]``m/sec`

drag_forces = []
for velocities in v:
	drag_forces.append((0.5*cd*rho*A*velocities*velocities))

plt.plot(v,drag_forces)
plt.xlabel('Velocity (m/sec)')
plt.ylabel('Drag Force (N)')
plt.title('Velocity vs Drag Force')
plt.show()

CASE-2:

In the second case we will vary the value of coefficient of drag force depending upon how stream-lined a shape is.

 i) circular cylinder – CD = 1.2

 ii) square cylinder – CD = 2.0 (sharp edges are not good)

 iii) oval cylinder – CD = 0.6 (rounded edges are good)

 iv) wing shape – CD = 0.1

We will just create an array with minimum cd = 0.1 and maximum cd = 1.2, other parameters are same as case 1 except we won't be creating any array of velocity here and consider it as a constant value of 14 m/sec.

CONCLUSION

1.) The above two graphs obtained makes sense because according to the defined formula, drag force varies linearly with coefficient of drag force hence a straight line is obtained.

2.)Also, drag force is proportional to square of velocity hence a non-linear graph is obtained in the second case. As we know graph for a quadratic equation is a curve called a parabola.

3.) The above calculations were done considering a few assumptions. We assumed the density of air is constant and the effect of temperature and humidity on the density of air is neglected such as to create a ideal case.
